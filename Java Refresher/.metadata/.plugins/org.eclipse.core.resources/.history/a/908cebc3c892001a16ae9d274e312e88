package LambdaMethod;

public class LambdaMethod {
	
	/* Lambda expressions - similar to a method in an anonymous class, eliminate the enclosing method & anon class
	 * lambda expression passes the functionality of a method as a parameter, aka anon functions
	 * 
	 * Lambda expressions are anon functions that can be passed as arguments to methods
	 * Allows one to treat the functions like data
	 * 
	 * Benefits: Reduce code duplication, write methods that are more flexible and easier to maintain
	 * Drawbacks: don't work well with debugger, can be inefficient, result in stack traces that are difficult to understand
	 * Result in code that's difficult to understand, result in code duplication for commonly used functionality
